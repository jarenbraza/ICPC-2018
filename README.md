# ICPC-2018
This repository contains sample solutions to programming problems in preparation for the Southern California Regionals of ICPC 2018. These problems come from the ICPC Live Archive and the UVa Online Judge. Posted solutions have been accepted by the online judges at their respective source.

Thus far, these solutions have been written by:
- Me (https://github.com/jarenbraza).
- Nick (https://github.com/nickgraeff).

## Possible Future Changes
- Create a folder for each problem, containing the source code for the solution and a PDF of the problem statement.
- Post more than one solution with a distinct approach for a given problem if possible.
- Improve organization by catagorizing based on programming paradigms, the primary data structures used, etc.
